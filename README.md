# Task-8-Working-and-understanding-VPN
# üõ°Ô∏è VPN Privacy & Secure Communication

> Task 8 - Elevate Labs - Cyber Security Internship

## üìò Project Overview

This project explores the use of **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** to secure online communications and protect user privacy. Using **ProtonVPN (Free Tier)**, we demonstrate how VPNs work by masking IP addresses, encrypting traffic, and allowing safe browsing on public and private networks.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Understand how VPNs protect user privacy
- Learn to set up and use a free VPN service
- Verify IP masking and encrypted communication
- Evaluate performance with and without VPN
- Research VPN encryption standards and privacy policies

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **VPN Client:** [ProtonVPN (Free Tier)](https://protonvpn.com)
- **IP Checker:** [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
- **Web Browser:** Chrome / Firefox
- **Screenshot Tool:** Built-in Snipping Tool / Lightshot (optional)

## üîå VPN Setup Instructions

1. **Sign Up:**  
   Create a free account at [https://protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com)

2. **Download & Install:**  
   Download the ProtonVPN client for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

3. **Log In:**  
   Open the app and log in using your Proton credentials

4. **Connect to a Server:**  
   Use the **Quick Connect** option or manually select a free server (e.g., Netherlands)

5. **Verify IP Address Change:**  
   Visit [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) to confirm your IP has changed

6. **Browse Securely:**  
   Open any HTTPS website to confirm traffic encryption (padlock icon in address bar)

7. **Disconnect & Compare:**  
   Disconnect from the VPN and recheck IP and browsing speed for comparison

## üî¨ VPN Encryption & Privacy Research

- **Encryption:** AES-256 + 4096-bit RSA + Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- **Privacy Policies:**
  - No user activity logs
  - DNS leak protection
  - Based in Switzerland (strong privacy laws)

## ‚úÖ Benefits of VPNs

- Hides real IP address
- Encrypts all traffic, including DNS queries
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship
- Prevents ISP tracking and data throttling

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of VPNs

- Reduced browsing speed due to encryption
- Free plans may have limited servers and features
- Does not prevent phishing or malware
- Trust in VPN provider is essential
